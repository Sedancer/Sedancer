Hi there 👋, I'm Serhii Barannik

I’m a UK-based **Senior Front-End Developer & Tech Lead** with **over 12 years' experience**. I specialise in building high-performance, scalable web applications, leading teams, and mentoring engineers.

Most of my work is commercial, so I can’t share many repositories publicly. This profile features my personal projects and educational work.

I’m also the founder and head teacher of **Varson Lab**, where we teach kids programming, cybersecurity, and robotics in a hands-on, practical way.

When I need to switch off, I'm a casual runner and a firm believer in the power of teamwork.
