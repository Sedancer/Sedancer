# Hi there 👋, I'm Serhii Barannik

I’m a frontend developer and engineer, and a team lead with over 10 years’ experience building teams and mentoring colleagues. Most of my work is commercial, so I can’t share much of it publicly.

I’m also the founder and head teacher of a course for kids, where we teach programming, cybersecurity, and robotics in a hands-on, practical way.

And I’m a casual runner — when I’ve got a bit of free time and want to switch off, I head out for a run around the city where I live.

💻 Frontend / Fullstack Developer  
🌍 Currently building personal projects and sharpening my skills in TypeScript, JavaScript, React, and Node.js  
🚀 Open to collaboration and new opportunities
